🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://flix-predict-movie-recommender.streamlit.app/

FlixPredict is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
It helps users discover movies by analyzing metadata such as genre, cast, keywords, and plot descriptions to generate smart, similarity-based recommendations.

Designed as an end-to-end ML application, the project combines data preprocessing, NLP feature engineering, similarity modeling, and an interactive Streamlit interface to deliver a smooth movie discovery experience.
